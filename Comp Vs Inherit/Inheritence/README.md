  # Inheritance-Based Buttons

  This folder demonstrates creating button components using **inheritance** — a less suitable approach in React.

  **What is Inheritance?**  
  Inheritance means creating new components by extending a base class component.

  **Why it's not ideal in React?**  
  React discourages inheritance because it leads to rigid component structures and poor code reuse. 
  It’s harder to manage shared logic, and it doesn’t align well with React’s use of hooks and functional components.
