  # Composition-Based Buttons

  This folder shows how to create reusable button components using **composition** — the recommended pattern in React.

  **What is Composition?**  
  Composition involves building components by combining simpler ones. In React, this often means passing props and using `children` to extend and reuse components.

  **Why it works well in React?**  
  React’s declarative and functional nature makes composition intuitive and flexible. It encourages clean, modular, 
  and maintainable code — making it easier to scale applications.
