# React Fundamentals

This repository contains my journey through the core concepts of React. It includes examples and hands-on projects demonstrating key fundamentals of building React applications.

  Understanding the difference and use cases for components with or without internal state.

- **Component Lifecycle**  
  Exploration of React's component lifecycle methods and their practical use.

- **Lifting State Up**  
  Managing shared state across components effectively.

- **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**  
  Reusability through component logic abstraction.
